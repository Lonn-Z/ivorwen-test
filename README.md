# Problem Statement
Students that use UBCâ€™s Canvas and other assignment tracking applications such as PrairieLearn and WebWork find that it is difficult to maintain an up-to-date list of upcoming assignments. While Canvas has a to-do list built in, instructors do not always add their assignments to canvas as assignments, and may opt to use other features such as modules or announcements, or even different platforms altogether such as PrairieLearn or WebWork. As such, it is hard for students to have a single location for all of the assignments they must complete. To compound the issue, choosing to use external task managers is time consuming as students must manually add each assignment to the list, including any additional details they need and the due date.
